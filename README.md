# AI_learning
This repo is for storing my daily coding snippets, random thoughts, and draft works.
I just made an account on Kaggle—it’s super helpful for my AI projects since I can run popular models there for free.
AI is growing way faster than we could ever imagine, so I gotta keep up with it.
Keep going, keep learning, go go go!
